## Project Overview

The 3D Earbuds Project is designed to give users an interactive experience by allowing them to explore product details via hotspots placed on the earbuds. The key components of this project include:

- **3D Modeling**: Created in Cinema 4D, the earbuds were modeled to emphasize realistic textures and lighting.
- **Interactive Hotspots**: Each hotspot reveals unique selling points, providing users with an informative and engaging experience.
- **Responsive Web Design**: The accompanying website is fully responsive, optimized for both desktop and mobile users.

This project exemplifies a blend of design and functionality, illustrating the potential for immersive product showcases on the web.

## Features

The earbuds boast several features that are showcased through interactive hotspots on the website:

1. **Ergonomic Design**: Provides a secure and comfortable fit, suitable for various activities.
2. **Noise Cancellation**: Blocks out external noise for a focused listening experience.
3. **Extended Battery Life**: Up to 8 hours of listening on a single charge, with an additional 24 hours from the charging case.
4. **IPX5 Water Resistance**: Built to withstand sweat, rain, and intense workouts.

These features are designed to appeal to users seeking a high-quality, durable, and versatile audio solution.

## Technology Stack

The project utilizes the following technologies:

- **3D Modeling**: Cinema 4D for creating realistic renders of the earbuds.
- **Frontend Development**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with CSS animations for a smooth user experience.
- **Design Tools**: Adobe XD for wireframes and design documentation.
